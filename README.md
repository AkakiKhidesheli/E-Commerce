The main goal was to create a bilingual website where sellers could add the products and buyers could view and buy them. Full website is written by me (except JavaScript files and 'Add to Cart' modal), mostly using Django Core, Bootstrap, Crispy Forms and other front-end elements. Product images are copied from other websites for demonstrational purposes only. Wallpapers and logos (including logo used for the thumbnail) are designed by Freepik.
